# scripts

A collection of scripts that contain useful utilities and functions. 
Most scripts are written for bash/zsh shell in mind, although some are Ruby files which will need the Ruby interpreter to function.

On Linux, run `setup.sh` with admin privileges to automatically copy over these scripts into `/usr/local/bin`.
