# Provides functionality to expedite the creating, opening, and closing of LUKS2 encrypted files using `losetup`,
# `cryptsetup`, and `mount`.
# Usage to create an encrypted file:
#
# $ krypton create <size> <mount_point>
#
# Usage to open an encrypted file:
#
# $ krypton open <path_to_file> <path_to_other_file>
#
# The file will be associated with a loop device, opened with cryptsetup, and mounted to a location on disk.
# Usage to close a mounted block device:
#
# $ krypton close <path_to_file> <path_to_other_file>
#
# Pass the `-a` flag with no file arguments to close all devices.

# Don't print out pre-assigned local variables
